## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. Here is a detailed description of how a tool like **nft-animation-tools** would integrate with major cryptocurrency exchanges for automated trading and portfolio management.

First, it's crucial to clarify a potential point of confusion: **nft-animation-tools**, by its name, suggests a focus on Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and animation. Major centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken are primarily for trading fungible tokens (spot, futures) and not for direct, on-chain NFT trading.

Therefore, the integration described here assumes one of two scenarios:
1.  The tool has been expanded beyond its original NFT scope to include fungible token trading on CEXs.
2.  The tool uses CEXs to manage the *fungible token capital* (e.g., ETH, SOL, USDT) that is then used to purchase NFTs on decentralized marketplaces (like Blur, OpenSea) or to trade speculative tokens related to the NFT ecosystem.

With that context, here is how the integration works.
